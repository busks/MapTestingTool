## `STUDENT SCRAPER` `👨‍🎓`
*"What is a Student Scraper"?*
> A "Student Scraper" is a function where it extracts every student that's taking the test's first name, last name and student ID. It is a very easy-to-use function.

## `STUDENT REMOVER` `👨‍🎓`
*"What is a Student Remover"?*
> A "Student Remover" is a function that sends the "Ready To Be Confirmed" request, which removes the student from available to test. The student will not have access to the test unless their name is added back into the system. **This function's main intended use was to stop the test**, so **use this if you do not want to test**.
